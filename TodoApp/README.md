### ".NET6 simple CRUD application - Categories List"

In this project I made few thing like: 

- `CategoryController` with basic http methods (get, post, edit, delete)
- `migration` to my local MS SQL 2019 express
- simple `Category Model` with usage of Attributes
- `Views` where i support myself with `bootstrap 5` library (for nice looks) and `toastr` lib for some nice notifications

I also learned to use NuGet, i belive something similar to npm, yarn or composer. With its help i have installed:

- `EntityFrameworkCore` - orm making DB operations much easier
- `EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` - db provider
- `EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` - for nuget commands
- `Razor.RuntimeCompilation` - for hotreload functionality
